    title     = {Weakly Supervised Branch Network With Template Mask for Classifying Masses in 3D Automated Breast Ultrasound},
    abstract = {Automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is being rapidly utilized for screening and diagnosing breast cancer. Breast masses, including cancers shown in ABUS scans, often appear as irregular hypoechoic areas that are hard to distinguish from background shadings. We propose a novel branch network architecture incorporating segmentation information of masses in the training process. By providing the spatial attention effect, the branch network boosts the performance of existing neural network classifiers, helping to learn meaningful features around the mass. For the segmentation information, we leverage the existing radiology reports without additional labeling efforts. The reports should include the characteristics of breast masses, such as shape and orientation, and a template mask can be created in a rule-based manner. Experimental results show that the proposed branch network with a template mask significantly improves the performance of existing classifiers.},

    title     = {A Conservative Approach for Unbiased Learning on Unknown Biases},
    abstract  = {Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art in image classification, recent works address their unreliable predictions due to their excessive dependence on biased training data. Existing unbiased modeling postulates that the bias in the dataset is obvious to know, but it is actually unsuited for image datasets including countless sensory attributes. To mitigate this issue, we present a new scenario that does not necessitate a predefined bias. Under the observation that CNNs do have multi-variant and unbiased representations in the model, we propose a conservative framework that employs this internal information for unbiased learning. Specifically, this mechanism is implemented via hierarchical features captured along the multiple layers and orthogonal regularization. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate our method is effective for unbiased learning.},
